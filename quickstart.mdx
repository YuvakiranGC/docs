> Welcome to Gammacode! This guide will help you start using our AI-powered coding assistant in minutes. You'll learn the basics and try your first development tasks with Gammacode.

## What you'll need

Before starting, make sure you have:
* A terminal or command prompt
* A coding project to work with
* A [Gammacode](https://gammacode.dev) account (free to create)

## Installation

**Mac & Linux:**
```bash theme={null}
curl -fsSL https://gammacode.dev/install | bash
```

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell theme={null}
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://gammacode.dev/install.ps1 -OutFile install.ps1; .\install.ps1
```

## Authentication

Start Gammacode in any project directory:

```bash theme={null}
cd /your/project/folder
gammacode
```

If you're not authenticated, Gammacode will prompt you to log in:
1. A web browser will open to the Gammacode authentication page
2. Log in to your Gammacode account
3. Click "Authorize Gammacode CLI" to complete the setup

<Note>
Once authenticated, your credentials are saved locally. You won't need to authenticate again unless you explicitly log out.
</Note>

## Your first conversation

After authentication, you'll see the Gammacode welcome screen. Let's start with understanding your project:

```
> what does this project do?
```

Gammacode will analyze your files and provide a helpful summary. Try asking more questions:

```
> what programming languages are used here?
```

```
> show me the main files and folders
```

```
> what can Gammacode help me with?
```

<Tip>
Gammacode automatically reads your project files as needed. You don't have to manually provide context or upload files.
</Tip>

## Make your first code change

Let's have Gammacode write some code. Try a simple request:

```
> add a hello world function to my main file
```

Gammacode will:
1. Identify the right file to modify
2. Show you the proposed changes
3. Ask for your permission before making edits
4. Apply the changes once you approve

## Working with Git

Gammacode makes Git operations conversational and simple:

```
> what files have changed?
```

```
> commit my changes with a good commit message
```

```
> create a new branch for this feature
```

## Common development tasks

Try these typical coding scenarios:

**Fix bugs:**
```
> there's an error when users submit empty forms - fix it
```

**Add features:**
```
> add email validation to the registration form
```

**Refactor code:**
```
> make this function more readable and add error handling
```

**Write tests:**
```
> create unit tests for the authentication functions
```

**Code review:**
```
> review my recent changes and suggest improvements
```

## Tips for better results

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be specific about what you want">
    Instead of: "fix the bug"
    
    Try: "fix the login issue where users see a blank page after entering incorrect credentials"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Break down complex tasks">
    For large features, work step by step:
    
    ```
    > create a user profile database table
    ```
    
    Then:
    ```
    > build an API to update user profiles
    ```
    
    Finally:
    ```
    > create a frontend form for profile editing
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Let Gammacode explore first">
    Before making changes, let Gammacode understand your code:
    
    ```
    > analyze the current authentication system
    ```
    
    Then request changes:
    ```
    > add two-factor authentication to the login process
    ```
  </Accordion>
