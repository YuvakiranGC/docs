When you join a new project, Gammacode can help you understand the codebase structure rapidly.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to your project directory">
    ```bash theme={null}
    cd /path/to/your-project
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch Gammacode">
    ```bash theme={null}
    gammacode
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request a high-level overview">
    ```
    > give me an overview of this codebase
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Explore specific components">
    ```
    > explain the main architecture patterns used here
    ```
    ```
    > what are the key data models?
    ```
    ```

  <Step title="Understand component relationships">
    ```
    > how do these authentication files work together?
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Trace execution flow">
    ```
    > trace the login process from frontend to database
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

    ```
    > refactor utils.js to use ES2024 features while keeping the same behavior
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validate the refactoring">
    ```
    > run tests for the refactored code
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Best practices:
  * Ask Gammacode to explain benefits of modern approaches

    ```
    > find functions in NotificationService.js that lack test coverage
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate test scaffolding">
    ```

    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add comprehensive test cases">
    ```
    > add test cases for edge conditions in the notification service
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute and validate tests">
    ```
    > run the new tests and fix any failures
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Best practices:
  * Request tests for edge cases and error conditions
  * Ask for both unit and integration tests
  * Have Gammacode explain the testing strategy
</Tip>

  <Step title="Generate PR with Gammacode">
    ```
    > create a pull request
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enhance the description">
    ```
    > enhance the PR description with more context about security improvements
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add testing information">
    ```
    > add details about how these changes were tested
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Best practices:
  * Ask Gammacode to create PRs directly
  * Review generated PR content before submitting
  * Request highlights of potential risks or considerations
</Tip>

## Documentation workflows

### Maintain code documentation

Keep your codebase well-documented:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify undocumented code">
    ```
    > find functions without proper JSDoc comments in the auth module
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate documentation">
    ```
    > add JSDoc comments to undocumented functions in auth.js
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Improve documentation quality">
    ```
    > enhance the generated documentation with more context and examples
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify documentation standards">
    ```
    > check if the documentation follows our project standards
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Best practices:
  * Specify documentation style (JSDoc, docstrings, etc.)
  * Request examples in documentation
  * Focus on public APIs and complex logic
</Tip>

## Working with images and visuals

### Analyze visual content for development

Use Gammacode's image analysis capabilities:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add images to your conversation">
    You can:
    1. Drag and drop images into the Gammacode window
    2. Copy and paste images with Ctrl+V
    3. Provide image paths: "Analyze this image: /path/to/image.png"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request image analysis">
    ```
    > What does this screenshot show?
    ```
    ```
    > Describe the UI elements in this design mockup
    ```
    ```
    > Are there any issues in this architecture diagram?
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use images for context">
    ```
    > Here's a screenshot of the error. What's causing it?
    ```
    ```
    > This is our database schema. How should we modify it?
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate code from visuals">
    ```
    > Generate CSS to match this design mockup
    ```
    ```
    > What HTML structure would recreate this component?
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Best practices:
  * Use images when text descriptions are unclear
  * Include screenshots of errors and UI designs
  * Work with multiple images in conversations
  * Leverage visual analysis for diagrams and mockups
</Tip>

## File and directory referencing

### Efficiently reference code files

Use @ symbol for quick file and directory inclusion:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Reference individual files">
    ```
    > Explain the logic in @src/utils/auth.js
    ```
    This includes the complete file content in your conversation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reference directories">
    ```
    > What's the structure of @src/components?
    ```
    This provides a directory listing with file information.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reference multiple files">
    ```
    > Compare @file1.js and @file2.js for differences
    ```
    You can reference multiple files in a single message.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Best practices:
  * File paths can be relative or absolute
  * Directory references show listings, not contents
  * Use multiple file references for comparisons
  * Combine with specific questions for targeted analysis
</Tip>

## Managing conversation history

### Resume previous work sessions

Continue your development work across sessions:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Continue most recent conversation">
    ```bash theme={null}
    gammacode run --continue
    ```
    This resumes your latest conversation automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select from conversation history">
    ```bash theme={null}
    gammacode run --resume
    ```
    This shows a picker with your previous conversations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Continue with specific context">
    ```bash theme={null}
    gammacode run --continue "Continue with the authentication task"
    ```
    Resume with additional context or instructions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Best practices:
  * Conversation history is stored locally
  * Use --continue for quick access to recent work
  * Use --resume to select specific past conversations
  * All previous context and tool usage is preserved
</Tip>

## Advanced development workflows

### Using Gammacode as a development utility

Integrate Gammacode into your development pipeline:

**Add to build scripts:**
```json theme={null}
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint:gamma": "gammacode run 'review changes vs main and report any issues with filename and line numbers'"
  }
}
```

**Pipe data through Gammacode:**
```bash theme={null}
cat build-error.txt | gammacode run 'explain the root cause of this build error' > output.txt
```

**Control output format:**
```bash theme={null}
# JSON output for scripts
gammacode run 'analyze this code' --output-format json

# Streaming for real-time processing
gammacode run 'parse this log file' --output-format stream
```

<Tip>
  Best practices:
  * Use Gammacode for automated code review in CI/CD
  * Integrate with shell scripts using pipes
  * Customize prompts for specific project needs
  * Use appropriate output formats for different integrations
</Tip>
