# AI Scanner (Issue Hunters)

> AI Scanner is Gammacode's intelligent web-based code analysis tool that scans your GitHub repositories for security vulnerabilities, secrets, and code quality issues with detailed recommendations and one-click fixes.

## What is AI Scanner?

AI Scanner is a powerful web-based tool accessible at [https://gammacode.dev/profile](https://gammacode.dev/profile) that provides:

- **Security Analysis** - Detect vulnerabilities, injection flaws, and security weaknesses
- **Secret Detection** - Find exposed API keys, passwords, and sensitive data
- **Code Quality Analysis** - Identify code smells, performance issues, and maintainability problems
- **SCA Vulnerabilities** - Software Composition Analysis for dependency vulnerabilities
- **One-Click Fixes** - AI-powered automatic fixes for detected issues
- **Detailed Reports** - Comprehensive scan results with CWE categorization

## How AI Scanner Works

### 1. Connect Your GitHub Account

First, you'll need to authenticate with GitHub through OAuth to access your repositories:

1. Visit [https://gammacode.dev/profile](https://gammacode.dev/profile)
2. Sign in to your Gammacode account
3. Click "Connect GitHub" to authorize repository access
4. Grant permissions for the repositories you want to scan

### 2. Access AI Scanner

Once your GitHub account is connected:

1. Navigate to the **AI Scanner** section in your dashboard
2. You'll see your scan history and available scan types
3. If you haven't run any scans yet, you'll see an empty dashboard

![AI Scanner Dashboard](/images/ai-scanner-dashboard.png)

The dashboard shows:
- **AI Security Scans** - Your completed security analysis scans
- **New Scan** button to start a new analysis
- Scan history with completion status and IDs

### 3. Start a New Scan

Click the **"New Scan"** button to begin analyzing a repository:

![New Scan Selection](/images/new-scan-dialog.png)

The scan configuration dialog allows you to:
- **Select Repository** - Choose from your connected GitHub repositories
- **Select Branch** - Pick the specific branch to analyze (main, develop, feature branches)
- **Configure Settings** - Set scan parameters and preferences

Once you've selected your repository and branch, click **"Start Scan"** to begin the analysis.

### 4. View Scan Results

After the scan completes, you'll see a comprehensive dashboard with your results:

![Scan Results Dashboard](/images/scan-results-dashboard.png)

The results dashboard provides:

#### Security Overview Cards
- **Application Security Issues** - Count of detected security vulnerabilities
- **Secrets Detected** - Number of exposed secrets found
- **SCA Vulnerabilities** - Software composition analysis findings

#### Detailed Issue Lists
- **Issue Name** - Clear description of each vulnerability
- **CWE Category** - Common Weakness Enumeration classification
- **Severity Level** - Critical, High, Medium, or Low priority
- **File Path** - Exact location of the issue in your codebase

### 5. Fix Issues with One Click

Click on any issue to see detailed information and get AI-powered fixes:

The issue detail panel shows:
- **Complete Description** - Detailed explanation of the vulnerability
- **Security Impact** - What risks this issue poses to your application
- **Recommendation** - Step-by-step guidance for fixing the issue
- **References** - Links to security resources and documentation
- **Fix with Gammacode Issue Hunter** - One-click AI-powered fix button

## Types of Analysis

### Security Analysis
Detects critical security vulnerabilities including:
- **Injection Flaws** - SQL injection, NoSQL injection, command injection
- **Authentication Issues** - Weak authentication, session management problems
- **Authorization Flaws** - Access control vulnerabilities
- **Data Validation** - Input validation and sanitization issues
- **Cryptographic Issues** - Weak encryption, insecure hashing

### Secret Detection
Finds exposed sensitive information:
- **API Keys** - Third-party service keys and tokens
- **Database Credentials** - Passwords and connection strings
- **Certificates** - Private keys and certificates
- **OAuth Tokens** - Access tokens and refresh tokens
- **Custom Secrets** - Application-specific sensitive data

### Code Quality Analysis
Identifies maintainability and performance issues:
- **Code Smells** - Duplicated code, long methods, complex functions
- **Performance Issues** - Inefficient algorithms, memory leaks
- **Best Practices** - Coding standards and framework conventions
- **Maintainability** - Code structure and organization problems

### SCA (Software Composition Analysis)
Analyzes your dependencies for:
- **Known Vulnerabilities** - CVE-identified security issues
- **Outdated Packages** - Dependencies with available security updates
- **License Issues** - Licensing compliance and conflicts
- **Dependency Conflicts** - Version conflicts and compatibility issues

## Scan Types Available

### Quick Security Scan
- Focuses on critical security vulnerabilities
- Fast analysis for immediate security insights
- Ideal for regular security checks

### Comprehensive Analysis
- Full security, quality, and dependency analysis
- Detailed reports with extensive recommendations
- Best for thorough code reviews and audits

### Custom Scans
- Configure specific analysis rules
- Focus on particular file types or directories
- Tailored for specific project requirements

## Understanding Results

### Severity Levels

**Critical** ðŸ”´
- Immediate security risks requiring urgent attention
- High probability of exploitation
- Potential for data breaches or system compromise

**High** ðŸŸ 
- Significant security or quality issues
- Should be addressed in current development cycle
- Notable impact on application security or performance

**Medium** ðŸŸ¡
- Moderate issues affecting code quality
- Should be planned for future development cycles
- Potential future problems if left unaddressed

**Low** âšª
- Minor improvements and best practice recommendations
- Good to address during routine maintenance
- Primarily affects code maintainability

### CWE Categories
Issues are classified using Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standards:
- **CWE-943** - NoSQL Injection vulnerabilities
- **CWE-94** - Code Injection issues
- **CWE-79** - Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
- **CWE-22** - Path Traversal vulnerabilities
- And many more standardized categories

## Best Practices

### Regular Scanning
- **Before Releases** - Scan before deploying to production
- **After Major Changes** - Analyze code after significant updates
- **Weekly Reviews** - Regular scans for ongoing projects
- **New Dependencies** - Scan when adding new packages or libraries

### Team Collaboration
- **Share Results** - Export and share scan reports with your team
- **Track Progress** - Monitor issue resolution over time
- **Set Standards** - Establish security and quality thresholds
- **Review Together** - Use results for code review discussions

### Integration with Development Workflow
While AI Scanner is web-based, you can integrate it with your workflow:
- **Manual Scans** - Run scans at key development milestones
- **Report Sharing** - Download and share results with stakeholders
- **Issue Tracking** - Use results to create tickets in your project management tools
- **Documentation** - Include scan results in security documentation
