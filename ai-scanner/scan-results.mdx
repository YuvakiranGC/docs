## Common Vulnerability Types

### Injection Vulnerabilities

#### SQL Injection (CWE-89)
- **Risk**: Database compromise, data theft
- **Detection**: Unsanitized user input in SQL queries
- **Fix**: Use parameterized queries, input validation

#### NoSQL Injection (CWE-943)
- **Risk**: Database manipulation, unauthorized access
- **Detection**: Direct object construction from user input
- **Fix**: Input validation, query parameterization

#### Code Injection (CWE-94)
- **Risk**: Remote code execution, system compromise
- **Detection**: Dynamic code evaluation with user input
- **Fix**: Avoid eval(), use safe alternatives

### Authentication & Authorization

#### Broken Authentication (CWE-287)
- **Risk**: Unauthorized access, account takeover
- **Detection**: Weak password policies, session management
- **Fix**: Strong authentication, secure session handling

#### Missing Authorization (CWE-862)
- **Risk**: Access to restricted resources
- **Detection**: Unprotected endpoints, missing access controls
- **Fix**: Implement proper authorization checks

### Data Exposure

#### Sensitive Data Exposure (CWE-200)
- **Risk**: Information leakage, privacy violations
- **Detection**: Unencrypted sensitive data, verbose errors
- **Fix**: Encrypt data, sanitize error messages

#### Insecure Direct Object References (CWE-639)
- **Risk**: Unauthorized data access
- **Detection**: Direct database IDs in URLs
