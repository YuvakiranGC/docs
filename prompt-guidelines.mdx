> Learn how to write clear, effective prompts that help Gammacode understand your intent and deliver better results.

## Writing effective prompts

### Be specific and clear

The more specific your request, the better Gammacode can help you:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Good
Fix the authentication bug in login.js where users can't sign in with empty passwords
```

```bash Avoid
Fix the bug
```
</CodeGroup>

### Provide context

Help Gammacode understand your codebase and goals:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Good
Add error handling to the user registration API endpoint. We're using Express.js with async/await pattern and want to return proper HTTP status codes
```

```bash Avoid
Add error handling
```
</CodeGroup>

### Break down complex tasks

For multi-step requests, break them into clear components:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Good
Create a user dashboard component that:
1. Shows user profile information
2. Lists recent activity 
3. Has a settings panel
4. Uses our existing design system components
```

```bash Avoid
Create a user dashboard with everything
```
</CodeGroup>

## Common prompt patterns

### Code generation

**Pattern:** "Create a [component/function/class] that [specific functionality]"

```bash
Create a React component that displays a loading spinner with customizable size and color props
```

### Debugging

**Pattern:** "Fix the [specific issue] in [file/function] where [description of problem]"

```bash
Fix the memory leak in DataProcessor.js where event listeners aren't being cleaned up on component unmount
```

### Code review

**Pattern:** "Review [file/function] for [specific concerns like performance, security, best practices]"

```bash
Review the authentication middleware for security vulnerabilities and suggest improvements
```

### Refactoring

**Pattern:** "Refactor [specific code] to [improvement goal] while [constraints]"

```bash
Refactor the user service to use TypeScript interfaces while maintaining backward compatibility
```

## Context and constraints

### Specify your tech stack

Always mention the technologies you're using:

```bash
Add form validation to the signup page using React Hook Form and Zod schema validation
```

### Include relevant constraints

Mention important limitations or requirements:

```bash
Optimize the image upload component for mobile devices with slow connections, keeping bundle size under 50KB
```

### Reference existing patterns

Point to existing code when relevant:

```bash
Create a new payment method component following the same pattern as the existing CreditCardForm component
```

## Getting better results

### Use iterative refinement

Start with a clear request, then refine based on results:

1. **Initial:** "Add a search feature to the product list"
2. **Refined:** "Add debounced search with filters for category and price range"
3. **Further refined:** "Add search suggestions and highlight matching terms in results"

### Ask for explanations

Request explanations for complex changes:

```bash
Add caching to the API calls and explain the strategy you chose
```

### Specify output format

Tell Gammacode how you want the response structured:

```bash
List the security improvements needed for the login system, prioritized by risk level
```

## Troubleshooting prompts

### When Gammacode misunderstands

**Add more context:**
```bash
Previous request: "Update the styles"
Better request: "Update the CSS styles in components/Button.css to match the new design system colors from design-tokens.css"
```

### When results are too broad

**Be more specific:**
```bash
Previous request: "Improve performance"
Better request: "Optimize the ProductGrid component's rendering performance for lists with 1000+ items"
```

### When you need different approaches

**Ask for alternatives:**
```bash
Show me three different ways to implement user authentication: JWT tokens, sessions, and OAuth
```

## Working with files

### Reference specific files

```bash
Update the error handling in src/utils/api.js to use the new logger from src/services/logger.js
```

### Specify file creation

```bash
Create a new utility function in src/utils/validation.js for email format checking
```

### Request file organization

```bash
Reorganize the components folder to separate UI components from business logic components
```

## Advanced techniques

### Chain related tasks

```bash
Create a user profile page, add it to the navigation menu, and write tests for the new component
```

### Reference external resources

```bash
Implement pagination following the GitHub API pagination pattern
```

### Ask for documentation

```bash
Add JSDoc comments to the utility functions and generate a usage guide
```

## Common mistakes to avoid

❌ **Vague requests:** "Make it better"  
✅ **Specific requests:** "Improve loading performance by implementing lazy loading"

❌ **Missing context:** "Add validation"  
✅ **With context:** "Add client-side validation to the contact form using our existing validation library"

❌ **Too many tasks:** "Build the entire user management system"  
✅ **Focused scope:** "Create the user registration form with email validation"

❌ **No constraints:** "Style the button"  
✅ **Clear constraints:** "Style the button to match our design system's primary button variant"

Remember: Good prompts save time and lead to better results. Take a moment to think about what you really need before asking.
