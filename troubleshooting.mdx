## Common installation issues

### Windows installation issues: errors in WSL

You might encounter the following issues in WSL:

**PATH detection issues**: If you receive an error during installation, ensure that your WSL environment is properly configured and has the necessary dependencies installed.

**Command not found errors**: If you see `gammacode: command not found` when running `gammacode`, the installation directory may not be in your PATH. You can fix this by:
* Adding `~/.local/bin` to your PATH in your shell configuration file
* Restarting your shell or running `source ~/.bashrc` (or `~/.zshrc`)

### Linux and Mac installation issues: permission or command not found errors

When installing Gammacode, `PATH` problems may prevent access to `gammacode`.

You may also encounter permission errors if the installation directory is not user writable.

#### Recommended solution: Native Gammacode installation

Use the following command to run the native installer:

**macOS, Linux, WSL:**
```bash theme={null}
# Install stable version (default)
curl -fsSL https://gammacode.dev/install | bash

# Install latest version
curl -fsSL https://gammacode.dev/install | bash -s latest
```

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell theme={null}
# Install stable version (default)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://gammacode.dev/install.ps1 -OutFile install.ps1; .\install.ps1

# Install latest version
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://gammacode.dev/install.ps1 -OutFile install.ps1; .\install.ps1 latest
```

This command installs the appropriate build of Gammacode for your operating system and architecture and adds a symlink to the installation at `~/.local/bin/gammacode`.

<Tip>
  Make sure that you have the installation directory in your system PATH.

### File permission issues: root access problems

Sometimes user files will have root access where Gammacode can't write files directly. If you face permission denied issues:

**Linux/Mac:**

1. **Change directory owner to user:**
   ```bash theme={null}
   sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /path/to/your/project
   ```

2. **Fix file permissions:**
   ```bash theme={null}
   chmod -R u+w /path/to/your/project
   ```

3. **For specific files:**
   ```bash theme={null}
   sudo chown $USER:$USER filename
   chmod u+w filename
   ```

**Windows:**

1. **Right-click on the folder** → Properties → Security
2. **Click "Edit"** and select your username
3. **Grant "Full control"** permissions
4. **Apply changes** to all subfolders and files

**Alternative: Run Gammacode with appropriate permissions**

If changing ownership isn't possible, you can run Gammacode with elevated permissions:

```bash theme={null}
# Linux/Mac (use cautiously)
sudo gammacode

# Windows (run PowerShell as Administrator)
gammacode
```

<Warning>
  Only use elevated permissions when necessary, as it can create security risks and ownership issues with generated files.
</Warning>

## Authentication and permissions

### Repeated permission prompts

If you find yourself repeatedly approving the same commands, you can configure permissions using your `gammacode.json` configuration file or by creating specific permission rules. See [Permissions documentation](/permissions).

### Authentication issues

If you're experiencing authentication problems:

1. **Get a fresh API key** from your profile at https://gammacode.dev/profile
2. **Remove existing auth file**:
   ```bash theme={null}
   rm -rf ~/.local/share/gammacode/auth.json
   ```
3. **Re-authenticate** with the new API key:
   ```bash theme={null}
   gammacode login
   ```

If problems persist, you can also try:

```bash theme={null}
gammacode logout
gammacode login
```

This performs a clean logout and re-authentication process.

## Performance and stability

### High CPU or memory usage

Gammacode is designed to work with most development environments, but may consume significant resources when processing large codebases. If you're experiencing performance issues:

1. Use `/compact` regularly to reduce context size
2. Close and restart Gammacode between major tasks
3. Consider adding large build directories to your `.gitignore` file
4. Limit MCP server usage if you have many connected

### Command hangs or freezes

If Gammacode seems unresponsive:

1. Press Ctrl+C to attempt to cancel the current operation
2. If unresponsive, you may need to close the terminal and restart
3. Check if any MCP servers are causing the hang
4. Try running with fewer agents or tools enabled

### Slow or incomplete search results on WSL

Disk read performance penalties when [working across file systems on WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/filesystems) may result in slower performance when using Gammacode on WSL.

**Solutions:**

1. **Submit more specific searches**: Reduce the number of files searched by specifying directories or file types
2. **Move project to Linux filesystem**: Ensure your project is located on the Linux filesystem (`/home/`) rather than the Windows filesystem (`/mnt/c/`)
3. **Use native Windows instead**: Consider running Gammacode natively on Windows instead of through WSL

## Agent and MCP issues

### Agents not responding

If your custom agents aren't working properly:

1. **Check agent configuration**:
   ```bash theme={null}
   ls -la .gammacode/agent/
   ```

2. **Verify agent file format**:
   - Ensure YAML frontmatter is properly formatted
   - Check that `description` and `mode` fields are present
   - Validate that the agent file has a `.md` extension

3. **Test agent creation**:
   ```bash theme={null}
   gammacode agent create
   ```

### MCP server connection issues

If MCP servers aren't connecting:

1. **Check server status**:
   ```
   /mcp
   ```

2. **Verify configuration**:
   ```bash theme={null}
   gammacode mcp list
   ```

3. **Test server connectivity**:
   - For remote servers: Check if the URL is accessible
   - For local servers: Verify the command can run independently
   - Check environment variables are set correctly

4. **Review server logs**:
   ```bash theme={null}
   gammacode mcp get server-name
   ```

### Custom commands not working

If your custom slash commands aren't available:

1. **Check command files**:
   ```bash theme={null}
   ls -la .gammacode/command/
   ```

2. **Verify file format**:
   - Ensure files have `.md` extension
   - Check YAML frontmatter is properly formatted
   - Verify `description` field is present

3. **Test command creation**:
   - Create a simple test command manually
   - Check if built-in commands like `/help` work
   - Restart Gammacode after adding new commands

## GitHub Actions issues

### GitHub Action not triggering

If Gammacode GitHub Actions aren't responding:

1. **Check workflow file**:
   - Verify `.github/workflows/gammacode.yml` exists
   - Ensure triggers are properly configured
   - Check for YAML syntax errors

2. **Verify API key**:
   - Confirm `GAMMACODE_API_KEY` is set in repository secrets
   - Test the API key works locally

3. **Check permissions**:
   - Ensure the GitHub App has necessary permissions
   - Verify repository permissions include Contents, Issues, and Pull requests

4. **Test trigger phrases**:
   - Use `/gammacode` or `/gc` (not `@gammacode`)
   - Ensure comments are in issues or PRs, not elsewhere

### Action failing with errors

**Common solutions:**

1. **Check workflow logs** in the Actions tab of your repository
2. **Verify API key** is valid and not expired
3. **Check rate limits** - you may be hitting API limits
4. **Review permissions** - ensure the workflow has required permissions
5. **Update action version** - make sure you're using `@main`

## Configuration issues

### Configuration file problems

If Gammacode isn't reading your configuration:

1. **Check file location**:
   ```bash theme={null}
   ls -la ~/.gammacode/gammacode.json
   ls -la .gammacode/gammacode.json
   ```

2. **Validate JSON syntax**:
   ```bash theme={null}
   cat ~/.gammacode/gammacode.json | jq .
   ```

3. **Reset configuration**:
   ```bash theme={null}
   mv ~/.gammacode/gammacode.json ~/.gammacode/gammacode.json.backup
   gammacode
   ```

### Environment variable issues

If environment variables aren't being recognized:

1. **Check variable names**:
   - Verify correct spelling and case
   - Ensure variables are exported in your shell

2. **Test variable access**:
   ```bash theme={null}
   echo $GAMMACODE_API_KEY
   env | grep GAMMACODE
   ```

3. **Restart shell**:
   ```bash theme={null}
   source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
   ```

## Model and API issues

### API rate limiting

If you're hitting rate limits:

1. **Check your usage** at https://gammacode.dev/profile
2. **Reduce request frequency**:
   - Use `/compact` to reduce context size
   - Limit concurrent operations
   - Configure appropriate timeouts

3. **Optimize prompts**:
   - Be more specific in requests
   - Break large tasks into smaller parts
   - Use appropriate models for different tasks

### Model not responding

If the AI model isn't responding:

1. **Verify your API key** has sufficient credits at https://gammacode.dev/profile
2. **Try a different model**:
   ```
   /models
   ```
3. **Check for service outages** or maintenance windows

## File and directory issues

### Cannot read/write files

If Gammacode can't access files:

1. **Check file permissions**:
   ```bash theme={null}
   ls -la filename
   ```

2. **Verify directory permissions**:
   ```bash theme={null}
   ls -la .
   ```

3. **Fix ownership issues**:
   ```bash theme={null}
   sudo chown -R $USER:$USER .
   ```

### Project structure not recognized

If Gammacode isn't understanding your project:

1. **Ensure you're in the project root**:
   ```bash theme={null}
   pwd
   ls -la
   ```

2. **Check for configuration files**:
   - Look for `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `Cargo.toml`, etc.
   - Verify `.git` directory exists

3. **Initialize project context**:
   ```
   /init
   ```
