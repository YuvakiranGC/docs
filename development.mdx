> Learn how to set up and optimize your development environment for maximum productivity with Gammacode.

## Setting up your environment

### Install Gammacode

Get Gammacode installed and ready for development:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Gammacode">
    **Mac & Linux:**
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://gammacode.dev/install | bash
    ```
    
    **Windows PowerShell:**
    ```powershell
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://gammacode.dev/install.ps1 -OutFile install.ps1; .\install.ps1
    ```
  
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify installation">
    ```bash
    gammacode --version
    ```
    This checks that Gammacode is properly installed and shows the version.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authenticate if needed">
    ```bash
    gammacode login
    ```
    Follow the browser authentication flow to connect your account.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Development environment integration

### IDE setup and extensions

Optimize your editor for the best Gammacode experience:

**VS Code recommendations:**
- Install language-specific extensions for syntax highlighting
- Configure auto-save for seamless Gammacode file monitoring
- Set up integrated terminal for easy Gammacode access

**Terminal setup:**
```bash
# Add Gammacode to your shell profile for easy access
echo 'alias gc="gammacode"' >> ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
```

### Project initialization workflow

Set up new projects with Gammacode:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to your project">
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/project
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize Gammacode context">
    ```bash
    gammacode
    ```
    ```
    > analyze this project structure and suggest a development workflow
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up project-specific configuration">
    ```
    > /init
    ```
    `/init` analyzes your codebase and creates a project-specific `AGENTS.md` file containing build commands, code style guidelines, and project conventions that Gammacode will follow throughout your development workflow.
  </Step>
</Steps>

</Tip>

## Work with images

Suppose you need to work with images in your codebase, and you want Gammacode's help analyzing image content.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add an image to the conversation">
    You can use any of these methods:
    1. Drag and drop an image into the Gammacode window
    2. Copy an image and paste it into the CLI with ctrl+v (Do not use cmd+v)
    3. Provide an image path to Gammacode. E.g., "Analyze this image: /path/to/your/image.png"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Ask Gammacode to analyze the image">
    ```
    > What does this image show?
    ```
    ```
    > Describe the UI elements in this screenshot
    ```
    ```
    > Are there any problematic elements in this diagram?
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use images for context">
    ```
    > Here's a screenshot of the error. What's causing it?
    ```
    ```
    > This is our current database schema. How should we modify it for the new feature?
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get code suggestions from visual content">
    ```
    > Generate CSS to match this design mockup
    ```
    ```
    > What HTML structure would recreate this component?
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:
  * Use images when text descriptions would be unclear or cumbersome
  * Include screenshots of errors, UI designs, or diagrams for better context
  * You can work with multiple images in a conversation
  * Image analysis works with diagrams, screenshots, mockups, and more
</Tip>

## Reference files and directories

Use @ to quickly include files or directories without waiting for Gammacode to read them.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Reference a single file">
    ```
    > Explain the logic in @src/utils/auth.js
    ```
    This includes the full content of the file in the conversation.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reference a directory">
    ```
    > What's the structure of @src/components?
    ```
    This provides a directory listing with file information.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:
  * File paths can be relative or absolute
  * @ file references add AGENTS.md in the file's directory and parent directories to context
  * Directory references show file listings, not contents
  * You can reference multiple files in a single message (e.g., "@file1.js and @file2.js")
</Tip>

## Use specialized agents

Suppose you want to use specialized AI agents to handle specific tasks more effectively.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a custom agent">
    ```bash theme={null}
    gammacode agent create
    ```
    This opens an interactive flow where you can:
    * Choose location (Current project or Global)
    * Enter a description (e.g., "security analysis")
    * Select which tools the agent can access
    * The agent is created as `.gammacode/agent/agent_name.md`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use agents automatically">
    Gammacode will automatically delegate appropriate tasks to specialized agents:
    ```
    > review my recent code changes for security issues
    ```
    ```
    > run all tests and fix any failures
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Explicitly request specific agents">
    ```
    > use the code-reviewer agent to check the auth module
    ```
    ```
    > have the debugger agent investigate why users can't log in
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:
  * Create project-specific agents in `.gammacode/agent/` for team sharing
  * Use descriptive descriptions to enable automatic delegation
  * Limit tool access to what each agent actually needs
  * Agents help maintain focused expertise for specialized tasks
</Tip>
