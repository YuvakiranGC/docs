## Setting up your environment

### Install Gammacode

Get Gammacode installed and ready for development:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Gammacode">
    **Mac & Linux:**
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://gammacode.dev/install | bash
    ```
    
    **Windows PowerShell:**
    ```powershell
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://gammacode.dev/install.ps1 -OutFile install.ps1; .\install.ps1
    ```
    
    **Windows PowerShell:**
    ```powershell theme={null}
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://gammacode.dev/install.ps1 -OutFile install.ps1; .\install.ps1
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify installation">
    ```bash
    gammacode --version
    ```
    This checks that Gammacode is properly installed and shows the version.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authenticate if needed">
    ```bash
    gammacode login
    ```
    Follow the browser authentication flow to connect your account.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Development environment integration

### IDE setup and extensions

Optimize your editor for the best Gammacode experience:

**VS Code recommendations:**
- Install language-specific extensions for syntax highlighting
- Configure auto-save for seamless Gammacode file monitoring
- Set up integrated terminal for easy Gammacode access

**Terminal setup:**
```bash
# Add Gammacode to your shell profile for easy access
echo 'alias gc="gammacode"' >> ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
```

### Project initialization workflow

Set up new projects with Gammacode:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to your project">
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/project
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize Gammacode context">
    ```bash
    gammacode
    ```
    ```
    > analyze this project structure and suggest a development workflow
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up project-specific configuration">
    ```
    > /init
    ```
    This creates an `Agents.MD` file where you can add project-specific instructions that Gammacode will follow throughout your development workflow.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Daily development workflows

### Morning startup routine

Start your development day efficiently:

```bash
# Check Gammacode status
gammacode status

# Start your main development session
gammacode
```

```
> what did I work on yesterday?
> show me any changes since my last session
> what should I focus on today?
```

### Code review and quality workflow

Integrate Gammacode into your quality assurance process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pre-commit review">
    ```
    > review my staged changes for any issues
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Code quality check">
    ```
    > check for code smells and suggest improvements
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Security review">
    ```
    > scan my changes for potential security vulnerabilities
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Performance analysis">
    ```
    > analyze performance implications of my changes
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Collaborative development

Work effectively with your team using Gammacode:

**Branch management:**
```
> create a feature branch for user authentication improvements
> help me merge this feature branch safely
```

**Documentation workflow:**
```
> update documentation for the changes I made
> generate API documentation for the new endpoints
```

**Code handoff:**
```
> create a summary of my changes for the next developer
> explain how to continue this feature implementation
```

## Advanced development patterns

### Automated workflows

Integrate Gammacode into your automation:

**Git hooks with Gammacode:**
```bash theme={null}
# Pre-commit hook example
#!/bin/sh
gammacode run "review staged changes and flag any issues" --output-format text
```

**CI/CD integration:**
```bash theme={null}
# In your CI pipeline
gammacode run "analyze test coverage and suggest improvements" --output-format json > coverage-analysis.json
```

### Multi-project workflows

Manage multiple projects efficiently:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Project switching">
    ```bash theme={null}
    # Quick project switch with context
    cd ../other-project && gammacode run --continue "switch context to this project"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Cross-project analysis">
    ```
    > compare the architecture of this project with /path/to/other/project
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Shared workflow patterns">
    ```
    > help me standardize development practices across my projects
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting development issues

### Common workflow problems

**Authentication issues:**
```bash theme={null}
# Check status
gammacode status

# Re-authenticate if needed
gammacode logout && gammacode login
```

**Performance optimization:**
```bash theme={null}
# Check available models
gammacode models

# Upgrade to latest version
gammacode upgrade
```

**Context management:**
```
> clear conversation history but keep project context
> reset to a clean development state
```

### Debug workflow problems

When Gammacode isn't working as expected:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check system status">
    ```bash theme={null}
    gammacode status
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify project context">
    ```
    > what files and directories can you see in this project?
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reset if needed">
    ```bash theme={null}
    gammacode logout
    gammacode login
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best practices for development workflows

### Efficient communication patterns

**Be specific in your requests:**
```
❌ "fix the bug"
✅ "fix the null pointer exception in UserService.authenticate() method"
```

**Provide context:**
```
❌ "add tests"
✅ "add unit tests for the new authentication methods, focusing on edge cases and error handling"
```

**Use iterative development:**
```
> create a basic user registration form
> add email validation to the registration form
> add password strength requirements
```

### Project organization

**Keep conversations organized:**
- Use descriptive conversation starters
- Group related tasks in single sessions
- Use `gammacode run --resume` to return to specific topics

**Maintain clean project structure:**
```
> analyze our project structure and suggest improvements
> help organize these utility functions into logical modules
```

## Integration with development tools

### Version control integration

```bash theme={null}
# Commit with AI-generated messages
gammacode run "create a commit message for my staged changes"

# Branch management
gammacode run "suggest a good branch name for this feature"
```

### Testing integration

```bash theme={null}
# Test-driven development
gammacode run "help me write tests before implementing this feature"

# Test analysis
gammacode run "analyze test coverage and suggest additional test cases"
```

### Documentation integration

```bash theme={null}
# Keep docs updated
gammacode run "update README with the new feature documentation"

# API documentation
gammacode run "generate API documentation for the new endpoints"
```
