> Quick actions and built-in commands for efficient development workflows.

When using Gammacode, you can type `/` followed by a command name to quickly execute actions. Most commands also have keybinds using `ctrl+x` as the leader key.

## Bash commands

Start a message with `!` to run a shell command:

```
!ls -la
```

The output of the command is added to the conversation as a tool result, allowing you to discuss the results with Gammacode or use them for further analysis.

**Examples:**
```
!git status
!npm test
!docker ps
!cat package.json
```

## Available slash commands

### /compact

Compact the current session by summarizing previous conversations to save context space.

```
/compact
```

**Alias:** `/summarize`  
**Keybind:** `ctrl+x c`

This is useful when your conversation gets long and you want to preserve the important context while reducing token usage.

### /details

Toggle tool execution details on/off. When enabled, shows detailed information about tool usage and execution.

```
/details
```

**Keybind:** `ctrl+x d`

Use this to see more verbose output about what tools Gammacode is using and how they're being executed.

### /editor

Open external editor for composing messages. Uses the editor set in your `EDITOR` environment variable.

```
/editor
```

**Keybind:** `ctrl+x e`

This opens your preferred text editor for writing longer, more complex prompts or code snippets.

### /exit

Exit Gammacode.

```
/exit
```

**Aliases:** `/quit`, `/q`  
**Keybind:** `ctrl+x q`

### /export

Export current conversation to Markdown and open in your default editor. Uses the editor set in your `EDITOR` environment variable.

```
/export
```

**Keybind:** `ctrl+x x`

This is useful for saving conversations, creating documentation, or sharing your development process with others.

### /help

Show the help dialog with all available commands and keybinds.

```
/help
```

**Keybind:** `ctrl+x h`

### /init

Create or update the `AGENTS.md` file in your project. This file contains project-specific instructions that Gammacode will follow throughout your development workflow.

```
/init
```

**Keybind:** `ctrl+x i`

The `/init` command analyzes your codebase and creates a project-specific `AGENTS.md` file containing build commands, code style guidelines, and project conventions.

### /models

List all available AI models that you can use with Gammacode.

```
/models
```

**Keybind:** `ctrl+x m`

This shows you which models are available and allows you to switch between them for different tasks.

### /new

Start a new session, clearing the current conversation history.

```
/new
```

**Alias:** `/clear`  
**Keybind:** `ctrl+x n`

Use this when you want to start fresh with a new development task or conversation.

### /redo

Redo a previously undone message. Only available after using `/undo`.

```
/redo
```

**Keybind:** `ctrl+x r`

<Tip>
  Any file changes will also be restored. Internally, this uses Git to manage the file changes, so your project needs to be a Git repository.
</Tip>

### /sessions

List and switch between active sessions, allowing you to manage multiple conversations.

```
/sessions
```

**Aliases:** `/resume`, `/continue`  
**Keybind:** `ctrl+x l`

This is useful when working on multiple features or projects simultaneously.



### /undo

Undo last message in the conversation. Removes the most recent user message, all subsequent responses, and any file changes.

```
/undo
```

**Keybind:** `ctrl+x u`

<Tip>
  Any file changes made will also be reverted. Internally, this uses Git to manage the file changes, so your project needs to be a Git repository.
</Tip>

## Command categories

### Session management
- `/new` - Start fresh conversation
- `/sessions` - Switch between conversations  
- `/compact` - Summarize to save context
- `/export` - Save conversation to file

### Development workflow
- `/init` - Set up project configuration
- `/undo` - Revert changes and messages
- `/redo` - Restore undone changes
- `!command` - Execute shell commands

### Environment
- `/models` - Switch AI models
- `/editor` - Use external editor
- `/details` - Toggle verbose output

### Utility
- `/help` - Show all commands
- `/exit` - Quit Gammacode

## Using keybinds

Most slash commands have corresponding keybinds using `ctrl+x` as the leader key:

1. Press and hold `ctrl+x`
2. Release and press the command key (e.g., `h` for help)

**Common keybind patterns:**
- `ctrl+x h` - Help
- `ctrl+x n` - New session  
- `ctrl+x i` - Initialize project
- `ctrl+x u` - Undo
- `ctrl+x r` - Redo
- `ctrl+x q` - Quit

## Examples

### Development workflow
```
# Check current git status
!git status

# Initialize project configuration
/init

# Work on your code...
# Make a mistake? Undo it
/undo

# Continue working...
# Need to switch models for a complex task?
/models

# Export your session for documentation
/export
```

### Multi-session workflow
```
# Start working on feature A
> "Let's implement user authentication"

# Need to switch to urgent bugfix
/new
> "Fix the login timeout issue"

# Switch back to feature work
/sessions
# Select the authentication session

# Continue where you left off
> "Now let's add password validation"
```

### Shell integration
```
# Check what files changed
!git diff --name-only

# Run tests
!npm test

# Check build status  
!npm run build

# Deploy if everything looks good
!npm run deploy
```

## Best practices

### Efficient command usage
* Use keybinds for frequently used commands (`ctrl+x n` for new session)
* Combine shell commands with conversation (`!ls` then discuss the files)
* Use `/compact` regularly in long sessions to manage context
* Export important conversations with `/export` for documentation

### Session management
* Use descriptive first messages for easy session identification
* Switch between sessions with `/sessions` for different tasks
* Start new sessions for unrelated topics
* Use `/undo` freely - it's safe and reversible with `/redo`

### Development workflow
* Run `/init` in new projects to set up Gammacode configuration
* Use shell commands (`!`) to check status, run tests, etc.
* Combine `/undo` and `/redo` for safe experimentation
* Toggle `/details` when you need to debug tool usage
