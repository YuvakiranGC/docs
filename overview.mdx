## Quick setup in under a minute

**What you'll need:**
* A [Gammacode](https://gammacode.dev) account (free to start)

```bash theme={null}
# Install Gammacode (Mac/Linux)
curl -fsSL https://gammacode.dev/install | bash

# Go to your project directory
cd your-project-folder

# Launch Gammacode
gammacode
# First-time users will be guided through authentication
```

```powershell theme={null}
# Install Gammacode (Windows - if bash is not available)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://gammacode.dev/install.ps1 -OutFile install.ps1; .\install.ps1

# Go to your project directory
cd your-project-folder

# Launch Gammacode
gammacode
# First-time users will be guided through authentication
```

## How Gammacode accelerates your workflow

* **Transform ideas into working code**: Describe your feature requirements in natural language. Gammacode creates implementation plans, writes the necessary code, and validates functionality.
* **Intelligent error resolution**: Share error messages or describe unexpected behavior. Gammacode examines your codebase, pinpoints root causes, and delivers working solutions.
* **Smart codebase exploration**: Get instant insights about any part of your project. Gammacode understands your entire codebase structure and can integrate external data sources through [Model Context Protocol](/model-context-protocol) connections to tools like Google Drive, Figma, and Slack.
* **Streamline routine development tasks**: Eliminate time-consuming activities like fixing linting errors, resolving merge conflicts, and generating release documentation. Execute these tasks with simple commands or integrate them into your CI pipeline.

## What makes Gammacode different

* **Terminal-native experience**: No switching between applications or learning new interfaces. Gammacode integrates seamlessly with your existing development environment and workflow.
* **Direct code manipulation**: Beyond suggestions, Gammacode actively modifies files, executes commands, and creates commits. Extend capabilities with [Model Context Protocol](/model-context-protocol) to access design documents, manage tickets, or integrate with your custom toolchain.
* **Command-line composability**: Built for automation and scripting. Commands like `tail -f app.log | gammacode -p "Alert me about any errors in this stream"` work naturally. Integrate into CI with instructions like `gammacode -p "Translate new strings to Spanish and create a review PR"`.
* **Production-ready architecture**: Deploy using Gammacode API or host on major cloud platforms. Built-in [security](/en/docs/gammacode/security), [privacy protection](/en/docs/gammacode/data-usage), and [compliance standards](https://trust.gammacode.dev/) for enterprise use.
