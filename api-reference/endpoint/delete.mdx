# Team Workflows and Collaboration

> Build effective team processes around AI Scanner to ensure security findings are addressed systematically, responsibilities are clear, and your entire development team contributes to maintaining secure code.

## Establishing Team Processes

### Security Review Workflow

Creating a systematic approach to handling AI Scanner results ensures nothing falls through the cracks:

#### 1. Scan Scheduling
- **Pre-deployment Scans** - Mandatory scans before production releases
- **Weekly Security Reviews** - Regular scans of active development branches
- **Pull Request Scans** - Scan feature branches before merging
- **Dependency Update Scans** - Scan after adding or updating packages

#### 2. Result Triage Process

graph TD
    A[New Scan Results] --> B{Critical Issues?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Immediate Response]
    B -->|No| D[Regular Review]
    C --> E[Assign to Security Team]
    D --> F[Assign by Component]
    E --> G[Fix Within 24h]
    F --> H[Fix Within Sprint]
```

#### 3. Issue Assignment Strategy

**By Severity Level**:
- **Critical/High** → Security team + Component owner
- **Medium** → Component owner
- **Low** → Include in technical debt backlog

**By Issue Type**:
- **Security Vulnerabilities** → Security team lead
- **Secret Exposure** → DevOps team + Security team
- **Code Quality** → Technical lead
- **Dependencies** → DevOps team
